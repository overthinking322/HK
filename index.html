			<h1>ðŸŒ¸ Lore of Hello Kitty ðŸŒ¸</h1>
			<p>
				Hello Kitty, whose full name is <strong>Kitty White</strong>, was born
				in the suburbs of London on <strong>November 1st</strong>. Though she
				looks like a kitten, she is actually a <strong>little girl</strong> â€”
				cheerful, kind-hearted, and full of love.
			</p>
			<p>
				She lives with her twin sister Mimmy, her parents George and Mary White,
				and loves baking cookies, traveling, and making friends. Even though she
				has no mouth, she speaks through the
				<strong>language of the heart</strong> ðŸ’–
			</p>
			<p>
				Created by Sanrio in 1974, Hello Kitty has become a global symbol of
				kindness, cuteness, and eternal childhood. She reminds us that
				friendship is the most magical power of all âœ¨
